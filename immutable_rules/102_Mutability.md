Initially rules in the 100's are immutable and rules in the 200's are mutable.
Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted (that is, changed from immutable to
mutable or *vice versa*) may be immutable or mutable regardless of their
numbers, and rules in the Initial Set may be transmuted regardless of their
numbers.
