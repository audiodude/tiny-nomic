If the rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or if the legality
of a move cannot be determined with finality, or if by the Judge's best
reasoning, not overruled, a move appears equally legal and illegal, then the
first player unable to complete a turn is the winner.

This rule takes precedence over every other rule determining the winner.
