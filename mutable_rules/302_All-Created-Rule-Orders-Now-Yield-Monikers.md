# All Created Rule Orders Now Yield Monikers

(a) As a prequisite condition to consideration, all newly proposed rules must carry a title (hereafter, _the title_).

(b) The title must be included as the first line of the rule file, prefixed with an octothorpe (#).

(b) The first letter of each word of the title, when combined in the order of the words of the title, must itself be a word (hereafter, "acronym".)

(c) Either the acronym or the title must be included in the filename.
