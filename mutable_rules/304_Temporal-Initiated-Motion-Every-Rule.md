# Temporal Initiated Motion Every Rule

To ensure the progression of rule proposal, and allow for rule proposal to fail and advance to the next turn, the process of rule proposal (the "turn") is metered by certain time periods:

(1.a) When a turn begins, 48 hours is allotted for the player whose turn it is to propose a rule or amendment. If no proposal is made within this time constraint the turn is forfeit and the proposing player loses 10 points. 

(1.b) 12 hours for discussion and amendment of the proposed rule or amendment. This period is mandatory whether or not discussion occurs.  

(1.d) 24 hours for the players to vote. Votes are tallied either when all players have voted or this time period ends.  During the tally, players who did not vote during this period are considered as having "abstained"
