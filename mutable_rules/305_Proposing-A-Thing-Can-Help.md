# Proposing A Thing Can Help
Amendments may be proposed by an eligible player as long as a vote has not ended, and then the proponent may choose to have an amendment voted on.  
  
If the amendment recieves a majority YES vote before the pull request is closed (if a voter doesn't vote on the amendment it counts as a NO), 
the creator of the proposal must include the amendment in their proposal and then merge it as usual.
  
Each player is eligible to vote on the overall rule, and the amendment proposed (if any).  
  
Voters may vote YES on an amendment but NO on a proposal ("I don't agree with X, but X+Y is less bad so I vote yes on the amendment in case the full proposal passes")
