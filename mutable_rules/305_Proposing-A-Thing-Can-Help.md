# Proposing A Thing Can Help
Once per pull-request, an amendment may be proposed by an eligible player other than the creator of the proposal 
(specifically, the author of the pull request).

If the amendment recieves a majority YES vote before the pull request is closed (if a voter doesn't vote on the amendment it counts as a NO), 
the creator of the proposal may include the amendment in their proposal and then merge it as usual.

If a voter has already voted prior to the suggestion of an amendment, their vote for the amendment is a NO (as described above) 
until/unless they specifically vote on the amendment.
  
Therefore, each user is eligible to vote on the overall rule, and the amendment proposed (if any).
