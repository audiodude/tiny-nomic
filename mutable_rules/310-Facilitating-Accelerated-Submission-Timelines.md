# Facilitating Accelerated Submission Timelines

To ensure a reasonable speed of operation of the rules of the game, the following changes and clarifications are made:

(1.a) In the case of a turn whose proposal is successful, the turn ends and the next turn subsequently begins when the relevant pull request adjusting the rules is merged and the game state contains the new rule.

(1.b) In the case of a turn whose proposal is unsuccessful, the turn ends and the next turn subsequently begins when the vote concludes, either through all players having voted or the timer in TIMER (1.e) elapsing.

(1.c) In the case of a turn where a player forfeits their turn by means of the timer in TIMER (1.a) elapsing, the turn immediately ends and the next turn begins at the point where the turn elapses.

(1.d) In any instance where a player's score is expected to change, they should have the first opportunity to submit a pull request indicating as such; if they do not submit a pull request indicating the change within 12 hours, any player is allowed to submit the relevant pull request.

(1.e) In any case where a pull request should be merged by the rules without requiring a vote, any player other than the player who submitted the pull request may merge the request.

(1.f) In the case of a pull request with a successful vote, any player may confirm the tally and its success and any player other than the player who confirmed the successful vote may merge the request.

(1.g) Any player who merges a pull request improperly (either as a violation of this rule or as a violation of any other rule, such as 117) shall receive a penalty of 4 points.  If it is less than 72 hours since the improper merge, any player may request a reversion of the merge.

(1.h) In the case of a reversion pull request created under the terms of (1.g) or a pull request that updates the scores in a way indicated by other rules, no majority vote is required and the rules of (1.e) apply.

(1.j) Clause (1.h) takes precedence over any requirement for a majority vote in rule 117, assuming that such precedence is allowed by rules (such as 110 and 211) that determine precedence.
