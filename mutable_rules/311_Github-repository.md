Each rule shall be represented by a file in either the `immutable_rules/` or
`mutable_rules/` directory of the git repository where the game is being
recorded. No other files in the repository shall be constituted to represent a
rule or have the force of a rule.

The master branch of the repository will serve as a representation of the
current game state. No commits are allowed to be made to the master branch
except through the mechanism of a Github Pull Request.

Pull Requests must perform exactly one of the following actions:

1. Add a file to one of the rules directory, when a rule is enacted.
2. Remove a file from one of the rules directories when a rule is repealed.
3. Modify an existing rule file, when an amendment is made, or repealed, or when
   an amendment to an amendment is made or repealed.
4. Move a rule from either the immutable_rules directory or the mutable_rules
   directory to the other one, when a rule is transmuted.
5. Create a new player file in the `players/` directory
6. Perform some administrative task on the repository, at the discretion of the
   players. Pull Requests of this type can happen outside of the normal turn
   order, must be approved by majority vote of all players, and cannot
   materially affect the operation of the rules or the game. An example of this
   would be removing or replacing the LICENSE or README files.

The proper way to propose a rule-change is a Pull Request. Players vote on Pull
Requests/proposals by putting either "+1" or "-1" as a comment on the Pull
Request, or by using the proper :thumbsup: or :thumbsdown: emoji on the Pull Request comment.
