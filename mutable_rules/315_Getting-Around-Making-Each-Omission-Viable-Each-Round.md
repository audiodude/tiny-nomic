# Getting Around Making Each Omission Viable Each Round

From the point at which this rule is adopted, if at any time three consecutive
turns (eg Rule Proposals) are forfeited for any reason, by the application of
any present or future rule, the GAME of Nomic that this repository represents
will be declared OVER.

At such time as the game is declared over, the following must take place:

1. All write access to the repository must be revoked from all players, to the
   extent possible.
2. No more pull requests or issues may be opened. To the extent possible, this
   should be enforced with technical measures provided by Github.
3. All players will be considered as having lost the game and in no case shall
   a future winner be declared. This rule takes precedence over all rules
   declaring a winner.
4. Additionally, if at least three players vote in favor (by casting votes in
   the normal manner on the Pull Request that represents this rule), the
   repository itself shall be permanently deleted.
