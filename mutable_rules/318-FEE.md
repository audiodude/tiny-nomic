If a player's score requires updating, for any reason described in any of the
other rules, then the first player to create and merge a pull request that
updates the necessary score may be awarded 2 points. These points are known as
the "update fee" for the score change. This fee is deducted from the score of
the player whose score is being updated.

A player is only awarded a fee if he or she records it in the same pull request
that is updating the score. For example, if player A requires a score adjustment
of +10 points, player B may make a pull request that gives player A 8 points and
him or herself 2 points.

In no case may a player record a fee for updating his or her own score.
