# Nice Alternative Narratives Toward Understanding Complicated, Kafkaesque, Expository Text

To assist the layman in understanding complex rule behavior, this and all higher-numbered rules must include a brief statement (hereafter "Statement") that summarizes or incorporates with a fictional narrative a behavior of the rule.

The Statement must be in the form of a _limerick_.

A limerick is a form of poetry in five-line, predominantly anapestic meter with a strict rhyme scheme (AABBA), wherein the third and fourth lines are usually shorter than the other three.

Some definitions of limerick assert that a true limerick is always obscene. This requirement is not in effect for this game.

(The evaluation of whether or not, and how strictly a Statement must conform to this definition, being subjective, is left to the interpretation of voters and judges, or may be further constrained by other rules.)

```
the discussion and votes took time
it looked like his rule was just fine
  so he was apalled
  when a judgement was called
as his limerick did not really rhyme
```
